## **RxWebpage**- The reactive front end component of our UCF Senior Design project, Clever Coasters

A simple single page application that automatically refreshes whenever a change occurs in the database. Uses Node, Express and Mongoose to handle listening and handling requests, while our React component handles refreshing the display so waiters get real time updates on every coaster without having to press any buttons.
